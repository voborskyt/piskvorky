## Overview
This project provides a framework for developing and testing various AI engines for playing Tic Tac Toe (Piskvorky). It includes visualization tools, training capabilities, and comparison functionalities to help you develop and evaluate different AI strategies.

## User Workflow

   - Register your engine in main.py's SETTING dictionary
   - Train your engine using main.py

### Configuration Settings
```python
SETTING = {
    "RUN": True,        # Controls if training is running or paused
    "SAVE": False,      # When True, saves current engine parameters
    "Engine": EngineAI, # Your engine class to train
    "Generations": 7,   # Number of generations to train
    "PaMutation": 0.1   # Mutation probability
}
```

## Creating Your Own Engine

### Basic Requirements
Each engine must:
1. Be a class that inherits basic game evaluation functionality
2. Implement required methods for parameter handling and board evaluation
3. Be able to save/load its parameters for future use

### Template Structure
Use `EngineLinear.py` as a reference. Your engine must implement these methods:

```python
class YourEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.v_engine = "0.0.1"  # Version tracking
        self.board = None
        self.initialize_parameters()

    def initialize_parameters(self):
        # Initialize your engine's parameters
        # Example:
        self.parameters = {
            'param1': np.random.randn(size),
            'param2': np.zeros(size)
        }

    def mutate(self, mutation_rate=0.1, mutation_scale=0.1):
        # Implement parameter mutation for training
        pass

    def evaluation(self):
        # Implement board evaluation
        # Should return a numerical value representing board state
        # Positive values favor player 1, negative values favor player -1
        pass

    def evaluate_board(self, board):
        self.board = board.copy()
        return self.evaluation()

    def get_parameters(self):
        # Return copy of parameters
        return self.parameters.copy()

    def set_parameters(self, parameters):
        # Set parameters from saved state
        self.parameters = parameters.copy()

    def load_params(self, file=""):
        # Load parameters from file
        return self.set_parameters(np.load(file))
```

### Board Representation
- The game board is a 5x5 numpy array
- Values: 0 (empty), 1 (player 1), -1 (player 2)
- Winning condition: 4 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)

## Using the Framework

### Training Engines
Use `main.py` to train your engine:

```python
# In main.py, set your engine class
SETTING = {
    "Engine": YourEngine,  # Your engine class
    "Generations": 7,      # Number of generations
    "PaMutation": 0.1     # Mutation probability
}
```

The training process:
1. Creates multiple instances of your engine
2. Makes them play against each other
3. Selects winners based on game outcomes
4. Applies mutations to create new generations
5. Saves successful engines to `temp_engines/`

### Testing Against Other Engines
Use `main_komparace.py` to compare two engines:

```python
comparison = EngineComparison(
    engine1_class=YourEngine,
    engine1_datafile="./temp_engines/your_engine.npz",
    engine2_class=OtherEngine,
    engine2_datafile="./temp_engines/other_engine.npz",
    num_games=20,
    display_game=True
)
comparison.run_comparison()
```

### Tournament Mode
Use `main_tournament.py` to compare multiple engines:

```python
engine_configs = [
    (YourEngine, "./temp_engines/your_engine1.npz"),
    (YourEngine, "./temp_engines/your_engine2.npz"),
    (OtherEngine, "./temp_engines/other_engine.npz")
]

tournament = TournamentManager(
    engines_config=engine_configs,
    games_per_match=5,
    display_game=True
)
tournament.run_tournament()
```

### Playing Against Your Engine
Use `human_vs_ai.py` to test your engine interactively:

```python
game = HumanVsAI(
    engine_class=YourEngine,
    engine_datafile="./temp_engines/your_engine.npz",
    ai_starts=False  # True for AI to start
)
game.run_game()
```

## Engine Development Tips

### Evaluation Function
The evaluation function should:
- Return higher values for positions favorable to player 1
- Return lower values for positions favorable to player -1
- Consider factors like:
  - Piece positions
  - Potential winning lines
  - Blocking opponent's moves
  - Board control

### Parameter Management
- Keep parameters in a dictionary for easy saving/loading
- Use numpy arrays for efficient computation
- Consider using multiple parameter sets for different game stages

### Mutation Strategy
- Balance exploration vs exploitation
- Consider adaptive mutation rates
- Test different mutation scales

## Example Engines

### Linear Engine (Provided Example)
- Uses linear regression for board evaluation
- Simple but effective starting point
- Good reference for parameter handling

### Possible Approaches
1. Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Pattern recognition
   - Spatial feature detection

2. Deep Neural Networks
   - Complex pattern evaluation
   - Multiple evaluation criteria

3. Heuristic-based
   - Hand-crafted features
   - Strategic patterns

## Testing and Evaluation

### Key Metrics

- Game progress
- Training progress
- Tournament results
- Comparative analysis

## Best Practices
1. Version your engines
2. Save successful parameters
3. Test against multiple opponents
4. Use visualization tools for debugging
5. Implement gradual improvements
6. Document your engine's strategy

## Project Structure (For Developers)

- `SaveHandler.py`: Handles parameter saving
- `StartStopHandler.py`: Controls training flow

### Visualization Components
- `colors.py`: Color definitions for UI
- `my_dataclasses.py`: Data structures for game state

### Engine Interface
Required methods for custom engines:
- `initialize_parameters()`
- `mutate()`
- `evaluation()`
- `evaluate_board()`
- `get_parameters()`
- `set_parameters()`
- `load_params()`

### Data Management

  - Naming convention: engineType_version.npz
  - Example: LinEngine1.npz, ConvEngine1.npz

### Training Flow
1. Manager initializes games
2. Players use engines for moves
3. Winners selected based on game outcomes
4. Parameters mutated for next generation
5. Successful engines saved to temp_engines/

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Overfitting to Specific Opponents
- Problem: Engine performs well against training opponents but poorly against others
- Solutions:
  - Test against various strategies
  - Implement regularization
  - Increase training population diversity

### 2. Poor Generalization
- Problem: Engine fails to adapt to new situations
- Solutions:
  - Increase training diversity
  - Add randomization to evaluation
  - Improve feature extraction

### 3. Slow Evaluation
- Problem: Engine takes too long to make decisions
- Solutions:
  - Optimize calculations
  - Use vectorized operations
  - Simplify evaluation criteria

### 4. Unstable Training
- Problem: Training results are inconsistent
- Solutions:
  - Adjust mutation parameters
  - Implement early stopping
  - Save successful intermediate results

## Getting Help
- Review the example implementations in EngineLinear.py
- Use visualization tools to understand engine behavior
- Test against basic engines to validate improvements
- Analyze tournament results for performance insights
- Check the code comments for additional implementation details

Remember that developing a successful engine is an iterative process. Start with simple implementations and gradually add complexity based on performance analysis.
